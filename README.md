# Page View

## Context

The app is built using Ruby 2.5.0 and Rails 5.1.6, and bootstrap 4.1.1.

It sends inputted data to the page view API and displays visualisation of the return histogram data.

## Getting Started

Start up the API

`rails s -p 3000`

Start up the app

`rails s -p 4000`

Go to http://localhost:4000 and input values to display visualisation of the return histogram data.

You can run the test specs via `rspec` and a coverage report `index.html` will be created under the `coverage` directory.
